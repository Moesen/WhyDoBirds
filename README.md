# WhyDoBirds
Investigation of Master Thesis subject

# **ToDo**
- [ ] Write resume of most important points from `Visual exploration of migration pattersn in gull data`
    - What did they do
    - How did they do it
    - What can be used for this implementation
    - What results can be used to compare with
- [ ] Create dataclass for importing datasets
    - Take basis in [this implementation](https://github.com/LifeWatchINBO/data-publication/blob/master/datasets/bird-tracking-gull-occurrences/mapping/dwc-occurrence.sql)
- [ ] Make first attempt at implementing skeletonization
    - [ ] use previous method for quick results
    - [ ] use Emil implementation to see if it gives faster or better results
